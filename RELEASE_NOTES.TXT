Release Notes:
==============

- setting 'Wave' to '256:--off---' in the Voice Editor will be ignored by the
RM50, to apply this change to the RM50 you need to click on 'Upload via MIDI
to RM50' to reupload the whole voice. This is a limitation of the RM50
parameter change messages, not of the RM50 Manager software.

- the SY77/TG77 card W7732 (Syn Wave 2) is not yet recognized, if you load a
Voice that uses this card you will get a pop-up error complaining about an
unknown card ID number. Please post the Card ID number on the related Yamaha
Forums UK thread (see below) so I can add support for this card.

- the waveforms of the RSC3003 House & Rap card lack names as I haven't located
a list of all waveform names of this card yet. If you happen to have the booklet
that comes with this card which includes the waveform names list, please scan it
and provide the scanned list on the related Yamaha Forums UK thread (see below)
so I can add the waveform names for this card to the RM50 Manager.

- MIDI input and therefore Voice and Rhythm Kit Downloads from the RM50 are not
supported on Windows. The related functions are therefore greyed out. Please use
a separate utility such a C6Sysex Manager or MIDI-OX to download and save to
files Voice or Rhythm Kits from the RM50 and then load them into the
RM50 Manager from files.

- the RM50 Manager only supports plain binary sysex files that start with
'F0' hex and end with 'F7' hex. ASCII sysex files or standard MIDI files that
include sysex dumps aren't supported.

- Voice and Rythm Kit Name changes are not trasmitted to the RM50 in real time.
Use the 'Upload via MIDI to RM50' button instead.

- On Windows the available MIDI Devices list is updated only once when the RM50
Manager is launched. Any changes to the available MIDI Devices while the RM50
Manager is running are ignored.

- On Windows physically unplugging the MIDI Device currently in use by the
RM50 Manager or selecting a MIDI Device that's no longer available could cause
the RM50 Manager to hang or crash.
